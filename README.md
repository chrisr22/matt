# Matt
A simple reality check iOS app to help people with schizophrenia using the Google Cloud Platform

The purpose of the app is to show people how machine learning can be used to help people (very simply).

Built at a hackathon, Matt helps people with schizophrenia by allowing them to verify the number of people in front of them by clicking a button.
This is done by doing simple face detection powered by Google's Cloud Platform and using the number of faces detected to confirm the number
of people present. 

The app also speaks to the user. 

# To Do
1. Allow user to ask "How many people are in front of me?"
2. Detect/Identify objects other than humans
